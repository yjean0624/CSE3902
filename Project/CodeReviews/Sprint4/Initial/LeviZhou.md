Naming: Decent
The name of this class precisely explained what it does. And all the names of methods inside of this
class are gerundial phrase and make perfect sense. There is only 2 methods called remove and replace
could possibily be confusing, since this is a method of LevelManager. Making it a gerundial phrase may be better

Explain of Purpose: Pretty Good
The code perfectly explained what it does. And the logic flow is clear and readers have no difficult understanding this segment of code
