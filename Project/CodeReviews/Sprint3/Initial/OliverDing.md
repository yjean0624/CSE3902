Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
-This class is easy to realize and understand.
-The code is high readability.
-The variables names, and methods names are simple and clear.
-The funcionalities of the methods are clear
-Still nedd more comments 
The variable convention looks fine and easy to understand like myPlayer, myBrokenBrickBlock. However, the Console.Writeline seems not meaningful and better make that out print as comments to avoid misunderstanding. He also used TypeOf which is a good practice.
