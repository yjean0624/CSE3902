At first, I was confused by all these blocks classes because there are so many different blocks. So I had to go over to the very beginning to check the sprites they use in order to differentiate different blocks. For the break block, I could understand the break function but I do not quite know what does fix function work for. For the BrokenBrickBlock, the name is ambiguous. I was first think it was broke. Then I realized it just depicts just the texture of the block was broke(sorry for my poor english). For the PlayWithSolidBlock class, I think should use comment here instead of using WriteLine function.
