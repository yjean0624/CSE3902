Readability

Naming?
The name of the class is a noun and clearly indicates that it is for detecting collisions.
Variables dx and dy would probably be better of just being overlap.Width and overlap.height as they are much clearer.
IsPrecident is getting removed but it should probably be something like IsInOrder. 
AddStaticCollidables and AddDynamicCollidables should be Set instead of Add.
Variables are named consistently.
They don't give any information on implimentation or otherwise.


Explanation of purpose?
Class name clearly indicates what its purpose is.
Problems with purpose expressed below.
