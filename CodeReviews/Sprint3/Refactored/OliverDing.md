Number of minutes taken to complete the review: 15mins

This file does have relatively low coupling and separate the function with the other types of blocks and only focus on the collision response between player and broken brick block. This is improved with the use of ICollidable Interface. The code has high cohension and very piece of logic and property seems very tight together and there doesn't seem to be any major bug. Several other types of block have the same format.
