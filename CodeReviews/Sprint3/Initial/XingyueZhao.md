PlayerWithBrokenBrickBlockResponse.cs
Levi Zhou
The class only have 60 lines, so it is not a large class. The class does not use another class's method excessively, the method execute is useful. The class is independent from other classes. The class is not a lazy class, it does not do too little things. It does not have too many branches, it only has one switch class. The class could loose coupling even more.
If that block when collide with the player, it will pop up some coins. The class right now could not solve that problem. If will need more statements to do the detection reponse stuff and so on.
