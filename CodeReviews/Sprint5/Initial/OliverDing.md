Comments on Readability: This class is similar to LevelManager which manipulate all the sounds inlcuding background trach, collision sounds and sprite change sounds. Main functionality is to create a list similar to colliable list in LevelManager which is to collect all the possible sounds. 
The class has high Readability and all the name conventions and list usage is feasible. The variable names have meanings which can represent the sound list. The code is good with simplicity, reusability and Readability which can be considered generally as good codes.
Some things to improve is that still need to add background sound for underground level and some inbalance between different sounds including collision and sprite change.
