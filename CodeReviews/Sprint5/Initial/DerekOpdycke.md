Naming?
The name of the class is a noun and clearly indicates that it is for Managing sounds. SoundEffectManager 
could make someone think it only deals with sound effects and not background music.
Variables and methods follow naming conventions.
BackgroundMusic controlling methods should spell out BackgroundMusic because BGM is confusing.
Variables are named consistently.
They don't give any information on implimentation or otherwise.


Explanation of purpose?
Class name clearly indicates what its purpose is.
Only problem with explanation of purpose is with the BGM methods.
