Code Quality

Class does too much or too little?
All of the methods do sound related functions.

Methods do too much?
Methods do only what they are suppose to. 

Shotgun surgery?
Class does not require any other classes.

Duplicated Code?
PlaySoundEffect and StopSoundEffect use identical code but the code isn't even needed.

Inappropriate Intimacy?
Class does not require any other classes so it knows nothing about them.

Data Clump?
There are not any groups of data being unnecessarily being passed around.

Cyclomatic Complexity?
All of the methods have a low complexity. 
PlaySoundEffect and StopSoundEffect have the highest but they dont need to be so complicated.

Too Many Parameters?
Methods and Constructors only take what they need. Most dont need anything.
